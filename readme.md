Wordpress Twitter Feed
===

This is a small wordpress plugin that we use to simply fetch a twitter users statuses. We can then take the raw status data and display it any way we like in a theme or other plugins. This plugin simply authorizes itself with any twitter application you designate to gain access to your twitter account.
